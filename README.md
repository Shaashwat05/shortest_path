# shortest_path

This project uses **Genetic Algorithm** to predict the shortest path between 2 points, overcoming obstacles in between. It is my 2nd project using this algorithm and it is amazing. It predicts only using random choices and fitness. **Matplotlib** is used to plot the output of each generation and finally the result.
